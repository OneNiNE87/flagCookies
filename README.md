## Description

Flag Cookies allows to globally delete all or some domain cookies (with particular permissions), separated by subdomains and even unknown and on every domain/subdomain on page load/reload/tab and window close.

Cookies can be allowed (permitted) or in particular forced to be deleted by "flagging" them.

Auto-flagging can be used for a domain (subdomain based) to auto clear all non permitted cookies, even undiscovered ones.

Global flagging does remove all non particular permitted cookies for all domains, even new ones.

Cookies are shown with name and value, to get a grasp on what is in the box.

## Requirements

**Firefox in version 58.0a1 is minimum**


## Installation

Please use the addons.mozilla.org : [Flag Cookies on Add-ons Mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flag-cookies/) as this is always the latest version, the self-hosted releases could be outdated.

Or download/clone the repository, to add the Add-on dynamically by using "about:debugging" in Firefox, which allows you to install, using the "manifest.json" file, if you point to it - but any cookie settings are stored temporarly. So installation of the add on from addons.mozilla.org is recommended.

## Thanks and notes

To phre4k for the initially idea!

To Cybergreek who pushed the major style change(s).
