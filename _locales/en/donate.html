<h3>Aid the development of FlagCookies</h3>

<p>
  Dear user!<br/><br/>
  Frequently I receive requests, to sell, to add advertisements, or some kind of tracking or search technologies inside, FlagCookies.<br/>
  I do not plan to sell your browsing data, or add some other kind of tracking, or advertisements.<br/><br/>
  If you like to support my goal to offer a great anti-tracking software which is keeping your privacy as protected and untouched as possible, you can now donate to archive this goal.<br/><br/>
  Or in case you speak another language than German or English, help to translate this addon.<br/><br/>
