  Hello!<br><br>
  Thank you for installing FlagCookies. FlagCookies is a 'hobby project' and an open source software.<br><br>
  I don't earn any money with my work on FlagCookies, but at this point I would like to start an appeal that is very close to my heart.<br><br>
  My mother has to move out of our parents house, because of an unsettled inheritance. From the house that my mother herself renovated and moved into with little financial means.<br>
  Also the house in which my brother and I grew up.<br><br>
  If everyone gives only a small contribution, my mother and us would be helped already very much. Even an amount of 1, - â‚¬ would be a sympathy.<br><br>
  To donate, you can use <span class="help-highlight">PayPal.me at <a href="https://paypal.me/dwroxnet">https://paypal.me/dwroxnet</a></span>.<br><br>
  Everyone who donates something can be mentioned by name in FlagCookies, on this donation page, if you wish. To do so, please email me <span class="help-highlight"><a href="mailto:jan@dwrox.net">jan@dwrox.net</a></span> with the PayPal payment information so I can match this.
  <br><br>
  Thank you very much
